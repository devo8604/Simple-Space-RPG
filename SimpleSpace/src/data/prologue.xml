    <mtext>
In a Galaxy far far far away in the distant future,
you are the Captain of an alliance battleship, trapped deep
within enemy territory with Intelligence information that could
finally put an end to this war. In order to make it back to Alliance
space, you must successfully make many FTL jumps. Your navigational computer will display how many times
that the enemy has the oppurtunity to stop you, and turn the tide
of the war in their favor...
